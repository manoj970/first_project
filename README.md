This is my first project
------------------------
1. What is a variable?

 A variable is a container that can store the data in a program it will easy to save and reuse when they are needed

2. Give 5 rules for naming variables in python?

-variables in python must start with underscore(_) or alphabets(a-z)
-variables are case sensitive **Age** and **age** are not same

-donot use python keywords(if ,else , class etc...)

-they cannot start with numbers

-dont use single word variables(a = 10) instead use descriptive type vaiables that will make easy to read and understand(User_name = "manoj")

3.What happens if you write x=10 and then x="hai"?

python uses dynamic typing here the variable x is reassigned .initially the integer is assigned to the variable then after the string is reassigned to the variable

4.Difference between = and ==?

** = ** is an assignment operator 
** == ** is an comparison operator

5.why do we use descriptive type names User_name instead of Un?

the descriptive type names are easy to read and understand it will avoid confusion

6.What error you will get if you use variable before assigning?

Nameerror : name is not found

7.how do you swap two variables in one line?

a,b = b,a

8.What is dynamic typing?

means you dont need to declare variable type(a = 10) python will consider it has integer

9.Can variable name start with numbers?why or Why not?

No,

10.What does del do to the variable?

it will delete the variables
